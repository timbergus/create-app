export const createTemplate = (appName) => `# ${appName}

This is my new and awesome CPP application.

Code lives in \`src/app\`. Includes lives in \`src/include\`. The app is build in \`bin\`.

1. To build the app: \`make\`
2. To run the app: \`make start\`
3. To clean the app: \`make clean\`

Enjoy :)
