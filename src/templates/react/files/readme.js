export const createTemplate = (appName) => `# ${appName}

This is my new and awesome React application.

Code lives in \`src\`. Public files live in \`public\`. The application is built using [bun](https://bun.sh)

1. To run the app: \`bun start\`
2. To test the app: \`bun test\`

> WARNING: Bun is pretty young tool. This is pure experimental. Use wisely.

Enjoy :)
